### *Your AI-powered "Farmer's Friend" for hyperlocal agricultural intelligence, delivered directly through WhatsApp.*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**KrishiMitra** is a sophisticated, multilingual AI chatbot designed to empower farmers in India by providing **instant, actionable agricultural intelligence**.

## ✨ Core Features

This isn't just a chatbot — it's a **suite of powerful AI tools** tailored for the modern farmer.

### 1. 🐛 Hybrid AI Pest & Disease Diagnosis

The **core innovation** of KrishiMitra.
When a user sends a photo of a sick plant, the system performs a **two-step hybrid analysis**:

* **Step 1 (Custom Model):**
  A fast, **TensorFlow/Keras-based custom model** provides an instant diagnosis in milliseconds — handling common cases efficiently.
* **Step 2 (AI Fallback):**
  If model confidence is low, the image is automatically sent to **Google Gemini Vision AI** for advanced analysis.

✅ *This hybrid architecture combines speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency.*

### 2. 📈 Real-Time Market Prices (Mandi Bhav)

Ask natural-language questions like:

> “What is the price of wheat in Khargone?”
